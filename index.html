                <h2>Kebab recipes</h2>
                <p>Kebab is a cooked meat dish, with its origins in Middle Eastern cuisine. Many variants are popular
                    around the world.

                    In most English-speaking countries, a kebab may be the classic shish kebab or shashlik, outside of
                    North America where it is better known as gyros,the more recent and now-ubiquitous fast-food doner
                    kebab.</p>

                <h2>beef steak</h2>
                <p>A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut
                    perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass
                    ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz). Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled.
